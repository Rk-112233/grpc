ðŸ”¹ 1. What is gRPC?

    gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework.
    
    It uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as the interface definition language.
    
    Communication is over HTTP/2 (faster, multiplexing, streaming).
    
    Supports many languages (Go, Java, Python, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Why use gRPC?

    Strongly typed contracts (proto files).
    
    Faster than REST (binary over HTTP/2 instead of JSON over HTTP/1.1).
    
    Built-in support for streaming.
    
    Easy code generation (client & server stubs auto-generated).
    
    Great for microservices communication.

ðŸ”¹ 3. gRPC Communication Types

    gRPC supports 4 types of RPC calls:
    
    Unary RPC â†’ simple request/response.
    Example: GetUser(id) â†’ User.
    
    Server Streaming RPC â†’ client sends 1 request, server sends multiple responses.
    Example: ListUsers() â†’ stream of User.
    
    Client Streaming RPC â†’ client sends multiple requests, server responds once.
    Example: UploadLogs(stream Log) â†’ UploadStatus.
    
    Bidirectional Streaming RPC â†’ client & server both stream messages.
    Example: Chat(stream Message) â†” stream Message.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Advanced gRPC Concepts

        Deadlines & Timeouts â†’ control request time.
        
        Error Handling â†’ gRPC status codes (codes.NotFound, codes.Unauthenticated, etc.).
        
        Interceptors â†’ middleware (logging, authentication).
        
        TLS/SSL â†’ secure communication.
        
        Load Balancing â†’ gRPC supports client-side LB.
        
        Reflection â†’ debugging with tools like grpcurl.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Summary : 
UnaryHello â†’ single request & response.

ServerStreamHello â†’ one request, multiple responses.

ClientStreamHello â†’ multiple requests, one response.

BidiHello â†’ continuous two-way communication.
